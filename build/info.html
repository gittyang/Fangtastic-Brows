          </div>

          <div class="info-item-body hide">
            <p>Microblading is considered a semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo that can dramatically correct or fully reconstruct lost or thinning brows due to aging or over tweezed brows. It is also an excellent choice for those wanting to simply enchance their brows to create a fuller and more enriched look. A microbladed tattoo typically lasts 1-3 years, depending on skin type and skincare routine. The procedure is done by using a hand tool with ultra fine needles (blades) and each 'hair' is gently etched into the skin to create a natural and realistic look. Choice of pigment/coloring are chosen to match the natural or desired brow color as well as the person's skin tone.</p>

            <p>Microblading is a <strong>2-step process</strong> and takes at least two appointments to complete.

After a <strong>6-8 week healing period</strong>, the second appointment (also known as the perfection session) can then be arranged to provide any necessary touch up on the client's brows.</p>

            <p>During the first microblading session, the technician will shape and style the client's brows to their satisfaction. This includes how high of an arc the client wants, length of brow, thickness, etc. Next will be the pigment color selection in which the technician and the client determines what color best matches the their natural or desired brow color. <br><br> Once the client is satisfied with the choices, we begin the microblading procedure. First the technician will clean the brow area and apply a topical anesthetic to numb the area. After a few minutes, the technician will begin the microblading process. Additional anesthetic may be reapplied if necessary.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="info-item-body hide">
            <p>After your first session, the eyebrow area will be slightly red and the color of your eyebrow will appear very dark. This is normal for the procedure as the new pigments have just been etched on the skin and your eyebrows are in the healing process. In the following days, the eyebrows will continue to be dark and you will notice slight scabbing. Do not pick at the scabs as this may damage the skin and the outcome of the microbladed area. <br><br> The eyebrows will lighten up in color as the overall color will fade by up to 40% as it continues to heal. It will take approximately 7-14 days for the brows to heal over and about 1 month for the color to fully set in. You'll notice the color is very light right after the two weeks of healing; the skin will have an opaque milky looking quality to it. This is due to the tissue still healing from the inside out even though the surface of the skin is healed. The true color will reveal itself once healed. <br> <br> In the mean time, it's recommended that you continue to follow post-care procedures to ensure the best outcome for your brows.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="info-item-body hide">
            <p>After your eyebrows has had the chance to heal for a period of 6 - 8 weeks, a touch up is necessary to address any other minor details in your eyebrows as everyone heals differently and the outcome will vary. For example, certain areas may not have been touched on during the first session and may need to be refilled, pigment color may need to be adjusted, or brow thickness and more strokes may need to be added. <br><br> Clients with oilier skin often require a deeper shade during the touch up session as the oils tend to lighten the pigment during the healing process, so this session gives the technician an opportunity to address that. Essentially, your second touch up session is when we refine and detail your brows to ensure that it looks the way you want it to so that you can wake up every morning with perfect brows!</p>

              <li><p>No makeup or cosmetic products to be used on the healing area for two weeks, using makeup may cause an infection.</p></li>
              <li><p>Avoid sun exposure and tanning for minimum of 4 weeks after your procedure. Direct sunlight can cause the pigment to change color while it’s healing.</p></li>
              <li><p>Avoid sweating for 2 weeks. Sweating may expel pigment through the skin producing poor results.</p></li>
